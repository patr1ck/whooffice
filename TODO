TODO

* Finish the Hubot script. Need to learn coffeescript first.
* whooffice-web API: /in_office.json should return a list of users, that's it.
* whoofficed needs a launchd plist and instructions on how to install it.
* whoofficed should take an interval time and a server name as launch arguments, for configurability.
* whoofficed needs to be cleaned up so that the POST is done in a sane way and errors are checked.
