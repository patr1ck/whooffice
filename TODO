TODO

* Finish the Hubot script. Need to learn coffeescript first.
* Add some API:
	* Need a POST API to associate employees to devices. Should be pretty simple.
	* Need a GET API to get the last time someone was in the office.
* whoofficed needs a launchd plist and instructions on how to install it.
* whoofficed should take an interval time and a server name as launch arguments, for configurability.
* whoofficed needs to be cleaned up so that the POST is done in a sane way and errors are checked.
